+ applications: Insert Lxmusic, Pcmanfm, Gpicview
+ PerformanceBaseTest: measure_and_validate() and validate()
+ upgrade run_usb and run_wifi to check if device is connected first
+ results: migrate view_results
+ Collector: change name to Dumper and migrate
+ applications: shell=False in linux.cmd
+ BasicTests: update
+ Where to put cpu,mem,bat thresholds and RESULTS_FILE?
+ change functions names to test_*
+ limit DUT resolution to 720p
- Should DUT resolution limit be automatic?
+ create central configuration location with defaults and ability to pass from command line (thresholds, etc...)
- Resources: fix bug: ValueError: max() arg is an empty sequence - what to do? save sample?
- Totem - "could not initialize supporting library"
